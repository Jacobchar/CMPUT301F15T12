/**
 * Created by Jacob on 2015-11-28.
 *
 * This class helps us instantiate the camera, almost all of the code involving the camera was taken from:
 * http://blog.rhesoft.com/2015/04/02/tutorial-how-to-use-camera-with-android-and-android-studio/
 * The above link is to the tutorial that walked us through using the camera in our app.
